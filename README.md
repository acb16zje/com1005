**Assignment 1:** 81 / 100

Basic Implementation | Credit | Mark | Comments
--- | --- | --- | ---
8-puzzle state class | 35% | 32% | Code/documentation OK. Used int[][]. Methods tested. Introduced P4 and P5.
8-puzzle search class | 5% | 5% | Code/documentation OK
Solutions to P1, P2, P3 | 10% | 5% | Solution paths not shown
**Experiments** | | |
Modifications to classes | 20% | 18% | Cost functions look okay.
Design of Experiments | 10% | 7% | Not explicit through can be seen from the report.
Presentation of results | 15% | 10% | OK. Should have separated Part 1 and Part 2
Discussion | 5% | 4% | Good

**Assignment 2:** 78 / 100

Productions, comments and explanation | 50% | 30% | Bagger2 checks all previous bags. Other techniques are higher efficiency and would fetch more marks. Good description of how bagger2 works though.
Experimental Results | 30% | 28% | Efficiency gain is well defined. Average over multiple seeds. However, you should compile this into one table as we dont really care what the initial seed values are.
Discussion and Conclusions | 20% | 20%
